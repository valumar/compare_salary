# Programming vacancies compare

Program to compare salaries for programming vacancies on [HeadHunter](https://hh.ru) and [SuperJob](https://superjob.ru)

### How to install

For proper use you have to get SuperJob account and get [SuperJob API Token](https://api.superjob.ru/).
After that rename the file `.env-example` to `.env` and paste your SuperJob API Token.

Python3 should be already installed. 
It is strictly recommended that you use [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for project isolation. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
